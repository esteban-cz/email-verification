# How to run locally:
``` I created batch files for simplicity of setting up and starting the server ``` <br>
``` You can basically set up and run this app without any knowledge of coding :) ```
## Download the .zip
### After you download it, extract the email-verification-master folder somewhere

## <br> Now you can just open/start the ```Start the server``` shortcut 
### This will navigate you through settings needed for the app
### After the setup is done it will automatically start the server :)
